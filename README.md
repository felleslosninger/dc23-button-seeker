# Universal Design Analyzer Extension

## About

This extension analyzes the current website and tests various properties against WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) requirements. It focuses on evaluating the following important properties:

### Intuitive and User-Friendly Buttons

The extension checks if buttons are designed in a way that makes them easy to understand and use for users. It verifies the intuitive nature of buttons to enhance user experience and accessibility.

### Alternative Text for Non-Text Content

It verifies whether images and non-text items have appropriate alternative text. Alternative text provides a textual description of the content, enabling users with visual impairments to understand the meaning conveyed by these elements.

## Target audience

This extension is created for developers who wish to automate tests on their websites. It's specifically designed for developers who already have some experience in web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Having prior knowledge of accessibility guidelines (such as WCAG) and a basic understanding of UX design principles is beneficial. Additionally, being proficient in using accessibility evaluation tools and staying updated with the latest industry trends can further enhance the advantages of using this extension.
